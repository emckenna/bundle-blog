git bundle example blog post

Git BundlesI very much enjoy working with Git.  After working with CVS and Subversion so many years, 
Git takes the pains out of using a version control system.  I'm always finding out new things about 
Git and how flexible it is.  My most recent discover has been with utilizing bundles.  If you are 
not familiar with Git bundles, here is an intro, http://git-scm.com/2010/03/10/bundles.html, but 
simply put, bundles are a way to package up a set of commits which can then be transferred by any 
means available, and committed to another repository.

I started off doing it wrong.
I began by following all the instruction on the intro page.

Then I got it right!
